# NeuralFlow

Minimal Next.js (App Router) setup with Tailwind CSS. This starter strips out the default marketing content so you can begin implementing your own features right away.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm, pnpm, or your preferred package manager

## Usage

Install dependencies and boot the dev server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app. Edit files inside `src/` to start building.

## Project Structure

- `src/app` – App Router entry points and global styles. `page.tsx` is intentionally minimal.
- `src/components` – Shared UI building blocks.
- `public` – Static assets (empty by default).

Feel free to adapt or remove any part of this scaffold to fit your workflow.
